# Introduction
Hello, This should be the main version of the hospyta-api-js version. I pushed it to the stage i got to in the vanilla javascript version. Didnt have so much time to test it to my content, as i was already on borrowed time. But none the less, good to see it now working fine.

# Start
To start the server and the application, get into the root directory and run nodemon index. This starts up the server and connects it to the database. And yeah! it's mongoDb i used here for it. Same with the js version.

# Problems i ran into
At first it looked to be working well, but then it just couldn't start. i started having problems in getting the application to work. spent alot of time trying to figure out why. Then I switched over to my "bestie" javascript and started building with javascript. Pushed it to level. then stopped since time was not my frienfd no longer. After publishing the javascript version, i started researching to try to fix the typescript problem i had, finally got it fixed it had to do with ts-node not loading files from tsconfig on startup. Fixed it and continued

# Chipping this in
This application like the js version doesn't have a clientside, everything was done using postman. Though there was a design of figma for it, but i couldn't access it. Had to improvise by using my head and imagination.

# Conclusion
I would try to finish this up later.
